title: EAR Production Suite
subtitle: A collection of production tools for Audio Definition Model (ADM) compliant production, brought to you by EBU, BBC R&D and IRT.
---

<div markdown="1" class="text_section">
The EAR Production Suite (EPS) is a set of VST® plugins for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that enable sound engineers to produce and author content using the ADM format and to monitor it for any ITU-R BS.2051 loudspeaker configuration using the ITU ADM Renderer. Moreover, the EAR Production Suite enables professionals to import and export ADM files, compliant to the EBU ADM Production profile (EBU Tech 3392). The VST® plugins are currently optimized for the Reaper DAW, which features an extension interface that is used to import and export ADM files within a BW64 container. Apart from using it for productions, we envisage the EAR Production Suite as role model for further ADM implementations to harmonize ADM workflows and functionality.

The EAR Production Suite is a joint development of [BBC R&D](https://bbc.co.uk/rd) and [IRT](https://www.irt.de/en/home)
